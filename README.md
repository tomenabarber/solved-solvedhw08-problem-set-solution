HW08-1:(File Browser) Create a file browser (similar to Windows Explorer) based on the programs in Figs. 15.14, 15.28 and 15.31. The file browser should have a TreeView, which allows the user to browse directories. There should also be a ListView, which displays the contents (all subdirectories and files) of the directory being browsed. Double clicking a file in the ListViewshould open it, and double clicking a directory in either the ListView or the TreeView should browse it. If a file or directory cannot be accessed because of its permission settings, notify the user.

HW08-2(Restaurant Bill Calculator) A restaurant wants an app that calculates a table’s bill. The app should display all the menu items from Fig. 15.53 in four ComboBoxes. Each ComboBox should contain a category of food offered by the restaurant (Beverage, Appetizer, Main Course and Dessert). The user can choose from one of these ComboBoxes to add an item to a table’s bill. As each item is selected in the ComboBoxes, add the price of that item to the bill. The user can click the Clear Bill Button to restore the Subtotal:, Tax: and Total: fields to $0.00.
